// Personal Deduction Calculator (Art. 77 Cod Fiscal)
// ============================================================
// The personal deduction is a percentage of the minimum wage.
// The percentage depends on:
//   1. How much the gross monthly salary exceeds the minimum wage
//   2. The number of dependents
// For every 50 RON above minimum wage, the base percentage decreases by 0.5%.
// Maximum eligibility: minimum wage + 2,000 RON (i.e. 6,050 RON for 2026 H1).
// Above that threshold, no personal deduction is granted.
//
// Base rates at minimum-wage level (0 RON above min):
//   0 dependents → 20%, 1 → 25%, 2 → 30%, 3 → 35%, 4+ → 45%
